# SR Kit Team Proposal

## Purpose

This document describes the structure, function and purpose of a sub-section of the Student Robotics organisation called the *Kit Team*.  The  purpose of the *Kit Team* is to oversee and manage the development, maintenance and support of the Student Robotics Kit ([see below for a definition of the Kit](#Definitions)).

The *Kit Team* is lead and organised by the [*Kit Team Committee*](#The-Kit-Team-Committee), which develops and clearly communicates a vision of how the Kit should be.  That vision is coherent with the [values of Student Robotics](https://github.com/srobo/ops-manual/blob/master/about-the-charity/vision-mission-and-values.md). By communicating this vision with the rest of the *Kit Team*, the committee makes it clear to all volunteers what direction development is headed in, and how effort is best spent on furthering the organisation's values.

The *Kit Team Committee* delegates responsibilities and resources to the rest of the Kit Team.

    
## Structure

The *Kit Team* is a group of volunteers that provide a *Kit service* to the Student Robotics *Core Team*.

Members of the *Kit Team* have access to Student Robotics resources in order to fulfill the Kit service.

Volunteers ask the *Kit Team Committee* to join the *Kit Team*. There should not be a barrier to joining, but equally the *Committee* should ensure that resources are used in the best interests of the charity.

The *Kit Team* is separate from the *Core Team*. Although they should work closely with them. It is advised not to be a member of both the *Core Team* and *Committee* simultaneously, although this decision is at the discretion of the Trustees.

### The *Kit Team Committee*

The *Kit Team* is lead by a *Committee* that are responsible for fulfilling the aims of the *Kit Team*.

Members join the committee by application to the Student Robotics Trustees. The Committee will operate on a continuous / rolling timeline. (Clarification of rolling timeline)

The committee is a group of 3 - 7 people, and must have at least the following roles:
- Chairperson 
    - Convene and chair meetings of the *Kit Team Committee*
- Secretary
    - Ensure that minutes of Kit Team are taken and made available to the Trustees and other members of the Kit Team.
    - Provide reports to Trustees. (See [Accountability](#Accountability))
- Treasurer
    - Prepare and manage the budget, including approval from the Trustees.
    - Keep financial records (in a form to be agreed with the trustees).
    - Understand and follow the requirements defined in the [Money Matters](https://srobo.gitbook.io/ops-manual/annual-robotics-competition/money-matters) section.

Upon formation, the Kit Team should self-organise to elect these roles within the group, along with any other roles that they deem necessary, i.e Software Coordinator, etc.


## Responsibilities

The *Kit Team* is responsible for providing the *Kit* as a service to the core team in order to enable the competition. 

This includes:
- Development of Kit
- Maintenance and testing of Kit
- Manufacture/purchasing of Kit
- Technical support to competitors and volunteers.

The *Kit Team Committee* is responsible for:

- The management, tracking and distribution of assets within the *Kit Team*. 
- The management of the workload of members apart of the *Kit Team Committee* and/or wider *Kit Team*. 
- Ensuring projects are open source, open to contribution from external parties, and inviting to work on by volunteers.
- Maintaining a list of *Kit Team* members, with abilities and desired workload.
- Assigning and managing projects/maintenance to team members, this may be assigned to self organising subgroups of individuals.



## Definitions
- *Kit*:
  The hardware and software (including software services) that are provided to teams as part of the competition to enable robot functionality.


## Accountability

The *Kit Team* works directly under the *Trustees*, following the approach used by the *Core Team*. A report will be delivered to the *Trustees* every **4** Months allowing them to keep track of the state of the Team.

Minutes should be made available to the general public, sensitive data, such as budgeting, may be exempt from this. 


## Budget

Specific budgeting will be managed on a case by case basis, applying for budget from the *Trustees* in each of these cases. 

If deemed necessary a "Development Pot" could be made available to cover low-cost resources used in the development process.

# Anticipated/Frequency-Asked Questions

> Is the Kit Team responsible for software involved in the running of the competition, like "SRComp" software?

  No, the Kit Team's responsibility is solely related to the Kit (see the definition of "Kit" above.)

> How do I join the Kit Team?

This is answered in the [Structure](#Structure) section.

> I don't want to be involved in any kind of structure!

That's fine, you don't have to be.  You can work on things with your own resources!

> I'm worried about making a large commitment...

Only the *Kit Team Committee* are making a specific commitment. Members of the *Kit Team* can contribute as much or as little as you'd like.

You can, and should, make the amount of time that you are willing to put in clear to the *Kit Team Committee*.

> Can I be a part of both the *Kit Team Committee* and the *Core Team*

Yes, but it is advised against, due to the large workload. However there is nothing stopping you being part of the *Core Team* and working on projects inside the *Kit Team*.

> Why do we need this proposal, isn't everything fine as it is?

:snake: Python 2 :eyes:

SR's kit is aging, and development on it has slowed and fragmented.  In order for SR to remain relevant, there needs to be a directed and coherent effort to develop the kit it offers.
